# takeaway-javaScript - not working
Steps to learning a new language:
1. Read an intro guide to it to learn conventions.
2. Find the docs for the language, and cheat sheets.
3. Practice the syntax with some online coding courses.
4. Adapt previous code you know well into the other language to get a better understanding of it.
5. Find the testing language for that language, it helps to focus on the little things of the language.
6. Get stuck in, donâ€™t feel the need to learn everything in the new language from the beginning; learn the necessary things first(function, loops, classes, variables, conditionals etc.) then learn as you need them.
7. Do some kata code wars because they give the greatest variety of codes, and gets you thinking by yourself of what you need to do.
8. Asks some with experience in the language what they would have done to learn it.
9. Find out how you get visibility in the language for debugging.
10. Adapt your debugging process for the new language.
